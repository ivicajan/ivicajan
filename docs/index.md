## About me

I am Ivica Janekovic and I am a physical oceanographer currently working as a 
[Research Associate Professor](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/ivica-janekovic) 
at the [Oceans Graduate School, University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/ems/Schools/Oceans-Graduate-School). 

Previously, I was working as a senior research at the [Rudjer Boskovic Institute (Croatia)](https://www.irb.hr/eng/Divisions/Division-for-Marine-and-Environmental-Research) and was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Hawai'i, Manoa (US) [Brian Powell' lab](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/team/brian-powell/).

Within my research, I combine empirical, theoretical and numerical knowledge to understand major ocean processes in continental shelf oceans and the adjacent seas. 
I am developing and implementing different types of regional ocean/wave/atmosphere modelling systems aiming to better understand our oceans and atmosphere. 
During that jurney I often combine observations with numerical model dynamics, and/or connect different models to exchange their information during the integration, 
all to better estimate ocean and atmosphere.   

My special interest is in real-time applications and operational coastal ocean forecasting systems using atmosphere-ocean-wave (WRF / ROMS / WW3)
2-way coupled models and quantify their predictability and uncertainty. I am working on data assimilation in coastal and ocean-wide basin systems using advanced 
4D-Var techniques within ROMS model, utilizing HPC supercomputer facilities. Mentioned methods enable me to combine remote sensed and field measurements 
together with model dynamics in a dynamical and consistent way, better than any of them separately. 

Downscaling dynamics using 2-way nesting high-resolution approach in the atmosphere (WRF) or ocean (ROMS) using finite difference discretization, or unstructured 
ocean (SCHISM) models enables me to resolve dynamics at the scales of order of ~10 m. Numerical modelling with focus on advanced numerical techniques 
combined with data assimilation is core of my research activity. 

Working as a physical oceanographer I strive to keep and improve my connections, interactions and collaborations with different groups related to biochemical modelling 
to advance interdisciplinary research.
